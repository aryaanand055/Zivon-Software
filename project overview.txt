Fitness Studio Management System – Project Plan

Executive Summary

The Fitness Studio Management System is a comprehensive digital platform designed to optimize and modernize studio operations. It aims to enhance client engagement, streamline administrative workflows, and improve financial transparency by replacing manual procedures with a centralized, automated solution.

Website Architecture and Public Homepage

In addition to the internal management system, a public-facing homepage will be developed under the primary domain zivonfitness.com. This will serve as the digital identity of Zivon Fitness, designed with a modern, animated interface using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and other visual tools to provide a dynamic user experience.

Public Homepage Features

Hero Section: A visually impactful landing area highlighting the studio’s mission and services.

About Us: An overview of the studio’s background, team, and philosophy.

Services Offered: Detailed sections describing various fitness programs and specializations.

Contact Information: Embedded map, phone/email details, and a contact form.

Gallery and Testimonials: Visuals of the studio and feedback from satisfied clients.

Navigation to Management Portal: A dedicated button or link directing authorized users to the internal system via zivonfitness.com/manage.
